    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ponyo follows the adventures of Ponyo, a fish with a human head who is the daughter of a wizard and an ocean deity. After she meets five-year-old Sōsuke, a human boy, Ponyo becomes a little girl who knows nothing of the on-land world and eats only one food: ham. Sōsuke's mother serves her ramen, a Japanese soup with long, thin noodles.</p>
    <p>Traditional ramen broth may be either clear or cloudy, and the soup may be topped with a variety of ingredients, including fish, meat, soft-boiled eggs, mushrooms, seaweed, and spices. This inexpensive dish is often eaten at the counter of little stands called <i>yatai</i>.</p>
    <p>Sōsuke's mother does not make home-cooked ramen; instead, she uses instant noodle packets. She does promise the children a surprise, however: She adds soft-boiled eggs, pork, and green onions to the bowls to make them look fancier. Like a toddler, Ponyo expresses all the endearing emotions of trying something new: impatience, joy, and sleepiness after eating.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed chicken bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons <i>mirin</i></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, divided</li>
        <li>Olive oil for cooking (or cooking oil of choice)</li>
        <li>9 ounces pork (such as boneless ribs)</li>
        <li>2 fresh eggs</li>
        <li>1 packet ramen noodles</li>
        <li>1 leek</li>
        <li>Pinch of fresh ginger, grated or thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cup soy milk</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon white <i>miso</i> paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, boil 4 cups of the water. Add the bouillon cube, crushed chicken bouillon cubes, and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce (or miso paste, if using). Taste often and adjust the seasoning as you go, gradually adding more crushed chicken bouillon cubes or soy sauce (or miso paste, if using) to taste.</li>
        <li>While the broth warms, prepare the marinade: Pour the remaining soy sauce into a bowl and add the mirin, oyster sauce, and sugar. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Smash three garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife, and then thinly slice them. Add the garlic to the marinade.</li>
        <li>Oil a pan and cook the pork on both sides until it is completely white. Remove the pork from the pan and thinly slice the meat. Add the marinade to the pan and then add the sliced meat. Fry on both sides.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs in a pot of boiling water for 6 minutes, then drain and peel. In a separate pot, cook the noodles until soft. Divide the noodles between 2 bowls.</li>
        <li>Wash the leek and cut the white part into rounds. Chop the remaining garlic clove. Add the leek rounds to the broth, along with the ginger, the soy milk, and the remaining chopped garlic clove.</li>
        <li>While the broth cooks, cut the onion and green onion into thin strips, and halve the boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour the broth over the noodles in the bowls. Garnish with the egg halves and slices of pork, and sprinkle the onion and green onion on top. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
