    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Kiki's Delivery Service, thirteen-year-old Kiki leaves home to complete her apprenticeship as a witch. Being on her own for the first time in a new city is challenging, but the young witch decides to earn a living by making deliveries—on her broomstick. Kiki receives a call from Madame, an elderly woman who wants Kiki to deliver a home-cooked meal to her granddaughter for her birthday. Unfortunately, Madame's oven is not working, and she can't bake her usual herring and pumpkin pie. Unwilling to accept payment without making the delivery, Kiki helps Madame bake the pie, even though it means missing a party.</p>  
    <p>The pie is rustic and clearly made with love, but the delivery is a disappointment: Instead of thanking Kiki, the granddaughter complains, “I hate Grandma's stupid pies.”</p>
    <p>The story takes place in an imaginary European city, and the dish is probably meant to be a regional specialty that the grandmother is known for making. As an added touch, witches are often associated with pumpkins, so including that ingredient in the pie is likely a nod to the cliché.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ pumpkin or 1 butternut squash, depending on the season</li>
        <li>20 black olives, pitted</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>Pinch of paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons cream</li>
        <li>4 smoked herring fillets</li>
        <li>2 pie crusts, uncooked</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Scoop the seeds out of the pumpkin, cube the flesh, and steam for approximately 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice 10 olives, chop the garlic, and slice the onion into rounds.</li>
        <li>When the pumpkin is soft, remove it from heat and mash it into a purée. Add the salt, pepper, paprika, butter, and olives.</li>
        <li>Lightly brown the garlic and onion in the oil. Add the cream, and stir to combine. Warm the mixture, and then pour in the pumpkin purée. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture into the bottom of a pie pan in a flat, even layer.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the smoked herring into small pieces, and arrange them on top of the purée, evenly spaced.</li>
        <li>Cover the contents of the pie with one pie crust. Then cut thin strips from the other pie crust (or from scraps of the first) to lay over the whole crust, as shown in the photo.</li>
        <li>If desired, you can recreate the fish from the film by cutting out its shape and scales from another piece of pie crust and then placing those pieces on top of the strips.</li>
        <li>Use a knife tip to poke 10 small cross-shaped holes around the edges of the pie on top of the crust strips. Brush the entire crust with egg yolk. Place the remaining 10 olives in the holes for decoration.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie for 40 minutes at 350°F.</li>
    </ol>
