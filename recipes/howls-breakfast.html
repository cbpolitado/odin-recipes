    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Howl's Moving Castle, after meeting the wizard Howl,Sophie is cursed by a witch who steals her youth and transforms her into an old woman. Sophie finds refuge in the moving castle, Howl's magical fortress, by claiming to be a cleaning lady.</p>
    <p>Even when Sophie prepares breakfast for Howl and his apprentice, the wizard does not recognize her true identity. Meaning to spare an old woman some work, Howl takes a pan of bacon and eggs from Sophie. As he does so, their hands brush. The touch stirs something in the young girl.</p>
    <p>The film's setting is decidedly European, and the meal is a traditional, hearty English breakfast served with rye bread and cheese. Sophie can't talk about the spell she is under, so she simply polishes off her entire meal and then gives the castle a thorough cleaning, to let off some steam.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices bacon</li>
        <li>Olive oil for cooking (or cooking oil of choice)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 slice sandwich bread, crust removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In an oiled pan, fry the bacon slices on each side until crispy. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with the garlic powder (feel free to add less than the full ½ teaspoon, if desired), adding salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cut the slice of bread in half.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the hot pan and place the bread slices in the center. Flip the bread immediately so that both sides are coated.</li>
        <li>When the eggs have solidified, fold all four sides of the omelet toward the center of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cut the cooked bacon slices into pieces and arrange them on the omelet.</li>
        <li>Quickly fold the omelet in half to form a sandwich, with a slice of bread on each side.</li>
