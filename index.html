            <p>In one of the scenes of the animated film, a lady asks Kiki to deliver her special pumpkin and herring pie for her granddaughter who is celebrating her birthday. The pie is rustic and clearly made with love. The dish is probably meant to be a regional specialty that the grandmother is known for making.</p>
